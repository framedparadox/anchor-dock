.SYNOPSIS
    Builds self-contained Release publishes of Anchor and zips them for distribution
    (GitHub Releases, winget, manual download).

.DESCRIPTION
    Produces dist\Anchor-win-<arch>-<version>.zip for each requested architecture, containing the
    published app folder, and prints each zip's SHA256 (needed for the winget InstallerSha256
    entries — see docs/winget-deployment.md).

    WinUI cannot be AnyCPU, so each architecture is a separate publish: the -Architecture switch
    picks which. ARM64 is cross-compiled from an x64 host by the .NET SDK, so both zips can be
    produced on one machine — but only the x64 one can be smoke-tested there.

.PARAMETER Version
    Version string used in the output file names, e.g. "1.0.0". Defaults to the csproj's <Version>.

.PARAMETER Architecture
    Which architectures to publish: x64, arm64, or both (the default).

.PARAMETER CertificateThumbprint
    SHA1 thumbprint of an Authenticode code-signing certificate in the current user's (or the
    machine's) certificate store. When given, Anchor.exe is signed before the zip is built, which
    is what removes the SmartScreen "Windows protected your PC" prompt on first run.

    Anchor's public releases are NOT signed today — there is no certificate — so this is off
    unless you pass it. Everything else about the release is identical either way, so an unsigned
    build stays reproducible.

.PARAMETER TimestampUrl
    RFC 3161 timestamp server used when signing. A timestamped signature keeps verifying after the
    certificate itself expires, which for a downloadable zip matters more than it does for
    software that is reinstalled often.

.PARAMETER SignToolPath
    Full path to signtool.exe. By default the newest one under the installed Windows SDKs is used.

    pwsh scripts/package-release.ps1 -Version 1.1.0
    pwsh scripts/package-release.ps1 -Architecture arm64
