# Anchor

**Drop anchor. Launch anything.**

A native **WinUI 3**  dock for Windows.
Pin the apps, files, folders and web links you actually reach for. Snap the strip to any
edge of any monitor. It tucks itself away (behind the taskbar, if you like) until you
whistle for it with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd>.

One dock, or one per screen. Eight languages. Groups that fly out like a second dock.
Search that filters every pin at once. **No accounts, no telemetry, no ads, no admin rights.**

## Why a dock?

Windows already has a taskbar. Anchor is the strip you build for the handful of things you
*actually* launch — then it gets out of the way.

| | Taskbar | Anchor |
|---|---|---|
| Apps | Pin, yes | Pin, plus **files, folders, web links, shortcuts, separators and groups** |
| Layout | One bar, bottom (or a side) | **Float**, or snap to **any edge of any monitor** |
| Hide | Auto-hide the whole taskbar | Tucks **behind that edge** — at the bottom, behind the taskbar, with a small **notch** |
| Density | One row of apps | Groups open a **fly-out dock**; folders can stack macOS-style |
| Presence | Always on the taskbar / Alt-Tab | **Off both** — summoned from the tray or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> |
| Search | Start menu | A glass card that filters **every pin on every dock** |
| Data | Microsoft's | **`%AppData%\Anchor`**, exportable, no cloud |

Free and open source (MIT). Out of the box the only thing Anchor sends over the network is a
request for a web link's favicon, and the one other thing that ever could (an update check) is
off until you switch it on in `dock.json` — see [Privacy & data](#privacy--data).

The Add window (seven types — app, file, folder, web link, shortcut, separator, group) and Quick Search :

| Add to Dock | Quick Search |
|---|---|
| ![Add to Dock](img/addToDock.png) | ![Quick Search](img/quick-search.png) |

Settings is a Windows-Settings-style window (Mica, left navigation) with six pages.
Appearance has since gained gear position, group-on-hover and item-name toggles in place of the
old glass-frost slider:

## Features

- **Glass background** — Windows 11 taskbar-style acrylic. Real desktop blur, kept
  translucent even though a dock is never the focused window, with the DWM border rim suppressed
  so there's no outline around the rounded glass in any theme.
- **Theme** — choose **Light**, **Dark** (default) or **System** (follow the Windows setting)
  from Settings ▸ Appearance. The dock, its glass and the Settings/Add windows all switch together;
  a High Contrast accessibility theme always overrides it.
- **Rounded corners** — the native Windows 11 window rounding (DWM).
- **Taskbar-sized icons** — 24 px icons in 40 px cells by default, matching the Windows 11
  taskbar; Settings ▸ Appearance offers a smaller and a larger size too.
- **Item names** — tooltips on hover by default; Settings ▸ Appearance ▸ *Show item names* keeps
  the label visible under every icon.
- **Tray icon** — Anchor sits in the notification area while it runs. **Left-click** brings the
  dock to the front (even when it's tucked behind a screen edge); **right-click** gives you
  *Show/Hide dock*, *Search…*, *Add new…*, *Settings…* and *Quit Anchor*. Since the dock is
  deliberately off the taskbar and Alt-Tab, this is the always-available handle on a running
  Anchor — and it re-adds itself if Explorer restarts.
- **Global keyboard shortcut** — a system-wide hotkey (**Ctrl+Alt+A** by default) summons the
  dock: it un-hides it, slides it back out from its edge, raises it above other windows and gives
  it focus. Re-assign it in Settings ▸ Shortcuts by clicking the shortcut button and pressing the
  combination you want (Esc cancels, Backspace clears); Anchor tells you if another app already
  owns it. At least one of Ctrl / Alt / Win is required.
- **Eight languages** — English, Deutsch, Español, Français, हिन्दी, 日本語, Português (Brasil) and
  简体中文. Anchor follows your Windows display language by default, or pin one in
  Settings ▸ General; the change applies immediately, with no restart.
- **Several docks, one per monitor if you like** — add a dock from any dock's right-click menu or
  Settings ▸ Docks. Each has its own items, monitor, edge, auto-hide and always-on-top setting;
  theme, language, the global shortcut and start-with-Windows stay shared. The tray icon and the
  shortcut summon them all at once.
- **Groups** — club related apps, files or links into one dock icon, keeping a long dock short.
  Clicking it opens a **fly-out bar**: a second dock growing out of that icon — the same cells,
  glass and spacing as the strip itself, running across the dock's flow (vertical out of a
  horizontal dock, horizontal out of a side-snapped one) and always away from the edge it's
  snapped to. Fill a group by **dragging an icon onto it**, or with *Move to group* on an item's
  right-click menu; drag a cell sideways out of an open bar to put it back on the strip. A group's
  own menu offers *Ungroup*. Settings ▸ Appearance ▸ *Open groups on hover* (on by default) opens
  the bar as soon as the cursor lands on the icon; turn it off and a click both opens and closes.

- **Folder fly-outs** — turn on *Show folder contents* for a folder and it lists what's inside it
  in the same bar instead of opening Explorer, macOS-stack style. Click a subfolder to drill in,
  right-click an entry to pin it to the dock, and the last cell always opens the real folder in
  File Explorer.
- **Quick-launch search** — assign a shortcut in Settings ▸ Shortcuts and it opens a small glass
  card that filters every item on every dock. Type, arrow to the one you want, Enter to launch;
  Esc or clicking away dismisses it. Also on the dock's and the tray's right-click menus, so it is
  reachable before you have assigned a shortcut.

- **Per-item shortcuts** — give any icon its own system-wide combination from *Shortcut* on its
  right-click menu, including items tucked inside a group. Off by default behind one master switch,
  since every shortcut claims a combination from every other app; Settings ▸ Shortcuts lists the
  ones you've assigned.
- **Icon size, accent tint and magnification** — Settings ▸ Appearance offers **Small / Medium /
  Large** cells (Medium matches the taskbar), an **accent tint** switch for the acrylic, and
  macOS-style **magnification** that swells icons under the cursor.
- **Gear at the start or the end** — Settings ▸ Appearance (or *Gear to start/end* on the dock's
  right-click menu) moves the settings button to either end of the strip.
- **Drop a file onto an icon** — dropping a file on an **app** opens it with that app, the way
  dropping it on an exe in Explorer does; dropping one on a **group** files it in there. The target
  icon swells to say which will happen.
- **Move items between docks** — *Move to dock* on an item's menu re-homes it without losing its
  custom icon, arguments or shortcut.
- **Import / export** — Settings ▸ General saves every dock, item and setting to a file and
  restores one, which is how you move a dock to another PC.
- **Opt-in update check** — off by default. Set `"CheckForUpdates": true` in `dock.json` and the
  portable build asks GitHub whether a newer release exists; if one does, a tray item and an About
  banner offer the download page. It never downloads or installs anything (see
  [Privacy & data](#privacy--data)). Not present in the Microsoft Store build, which the Store
  keeps up to date itself.
- **Running-app indicators** — a dot under an app that's already open, and a click that brings its
  window forward instead of starting a second copy. **Shift+click** starts a new instance anyway,
  the way the Windows 11 taskbar does. Turn the whole thing off in Settings ▸ General.
- **Separators** — a thin divider you can drop anywhere on the strip to group icons visually.
  Add one from the dock's right-click menu or the Add window; drag it like any other item.
- **Custom icons** — *Edit…* ▸ *Change icon…* points an item at any PNG / ICO / JPG / BMP / GIF (or
  a glyph from the built-in set), and *Use the default icon* on the right-click menu puts the shell
  or favicon icon back.
- **Settings window** — a gear button opens a Windows-Settings-style window (Mica, left
  navigation) with a **General** page (language, running-app indicators, start-with-Windows,
  import/export, reset), an **Appearance** page (theme, icon size, gear position, magnification,
  group-on-hover, item names, accent tint), a **Shortcuts** page (the summon shortcut, quick-launch
  search, and the master switch plus a list for per-item shortcuts), a **Docks** page (one card per
  dock: name, monitor, position, transpose-on-side-edges, auto-hide, always-on-top, remove), an
  **Apps & links** page that lists every entry — grouped by dock, with a group's contents indented
  — with a show/hide switch and a remove button, and an **About** page (version, source/issue/license
  links, and a privacy expander).
- **Add-to-Dock window** — a Windows-app-style modal for adding an **app / file / folder / web
  link / shortcut / separator / group**, with a type picker, Browse, and auto-suggested names.

- **Automatic icons** — apps, files and folders use the Windows shell icon (the same icon
  Explorer shows); web links auto-fetch the site's **favicon**, cached to disk so it downloads
  once and still shows offline.
- **Drag & drop to add** — drag an app, shortcut (`.lnk`), file or folder from Explorer or the
  desktop straight onto the dock to add it; a URL dragged from a browser becomes a web link.
- **Reorder by dragging** — drag an icon left/right (or up/down when vertical) to rearrange it;
  dragging the dock's background moves the whole dock (the two gestures never conflict).
- **Snap to any edge → hides where you left it** — drop the dock near a screen edge and it snaps
  flush and auto-hides behind *that* edge on *that* monitor, revealing on cursor approach. It
  tucks behind the physical screen edge — at the bottom that means **behind the taskbar**, with
  only a small **notch** peeking over it — stays at the position you placed it along the edge (no
  jumping to center), and reveals when you reach the edge (or the notch). On an edge **shared with
  another monitor** it still hides, but shrinks down to the notch in place rather than sliding —
  so it never slides onto (or peeks out on) the neighboring screen.
- **Transpose (optional)** — a Settings toggle makes the dock stack its icons
  vertically when snapped to the **left or right** edge; top, bottom and floating stay horizontal.
- **Always on top (optional)** — the dock stays above other windows; a Settings toggle lets you
  turn that off while it's floating (when snapped it stays on top so the auto-hide reveal works).
- **Show / hide without deleting** — hide items from the dock (Settings ▸ Apps, or an icon's
  right-click menu) while keeping them in the list.
- **Empty state** — with no items the dock shows a **"＋ Add New"** button.
- **Per-item menu** — right-click an icon: Open, Edit (name, target and icon in one panel), Show
  folder contents (folders), Move to group, Move to dock (with more than one dock), Shortcut (with
  per-item shortcuts on), Move left/right, Hide, Remove.
- **Keyboard & screen-reader friendly** — items and the gear are real `Button`s: Tab / arrow-key
  focus, Space/Enter to launch, focus visuals, and Narrator names. Context menus are reachable
  with the Menu key / Shift+F10; auto-hide honors the *reduced-motion* and *high-contrast*
  accessibility settings.
- **Single instance** — launching Anchor a second time (e.g. from the Start menu while the
  "start with Windows" copy is already running) quietly exits rather than stacking a second set of
  docks. Scoped to the data directory, so a portable copy with its own `ANCHOR_DATA_DIR` still runs.
- **Persistent** — items, position, snap state and settings are saved to JSON and restored next launch.
- **Out of the way** — borderless, always-on-top, hidden from the taskbar and Alt-Tab.

## Install

Anchor is **portable** — there is no installer, no setup wizard and nothing written outside your
own user profile.

1. Download **`Anchor-win-x64-<version>.zip`** — or **`Anchor-win-arm64-<version>.zip`** on a
   Windows-on-ARM machine — from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/framedparadox/anchor-dock/releases/latest).
2. Extract it to a folder you intend to keep (e.g. `%LocalAppData%\Programs\Anchor`) — Anchor runs
   from where you unzip it, so don't launch it out of the Downloads/temp folder.
3. Run **`Anchor.exe`**. The dock appears above the taskbar and an anchor icon appears in the
   notification area.
4. Optional: turn on **Settings ▸ General ▸ Start with Windows** so it comes back after a reboot.

Notes:

- The zip is a **self-contained** build — ~86 MB compressed, ~215 MB on disk once extracted. It
  bundles .NET 10 and the Windows App SDK so nothing else needs installing. For a smaller
  download (~60–80 MB) that requires the [Windows App Runtime](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/deploy-unpackaged-apps)
  to already be installed, publish with `pwsh scripts/package-release.ps1 -FrameworkDependent` or
  `dotnet publish -p:FrameworkDependent=true --self-contained false`.
- **Updating** — quit Anchor (tray ▸ *Quit Anchor*), extract the new zip over the old folder, start
  it again. Your dock lives in `%AppData%\Anchor` and is untouched by the swap.
- **Uninstalling** — quit Anchor, turn off *Start with Windows* first (or delete the `Anchor` value
  under `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`), then delete the extracted folder and
  `%AppData%\Anchor`.
- First-run SmartScreen may warn because releases are **not code-signed yet** — choose
  *More info ▸ Run anyway*. See [Known limitations](#known-limitations).

## Requirements

- Windows 11 (tested on build 26200) — Windows 10 1809+ (build 17763) should also work; that is
  the app's `TargetPlatformMinVersion`.
- **x64 or ARM64.** WinUI cannot target `AnyCPU`, so each is a separate build: pass
  `-p:Platform=x64` (the default) or `-p:Platform=ARM64`, and the runtime identifier follows. There
  is no x86 build. The ARM64 build cross-compiles from an x64 host, but only the x64 one can be
  smoke-tested there — an ARM64 release should be tried on real hardware before it ships.
- No admin rights, at install or at run time.
- To *build* it: the **.NET 10 SDK**. The build is **self-contained**, so the Windows App Runtime
  does **not** need to be installed separately — on either your machine or a user's.

## Build & run

```powershell
# from the repo root
dotnet build src/Anchor/Anchor.csproj -c Release -p:Platform=x64

# run it
./src/Anchor/bin/x64/Release/net10.0-windows10.0.26100.0/win-x64/Anchor.exe

# natively for Windows on ARM (cross-compiles fine from an x64 host)
dotnet build src/Anchor/Anchor.csproj -c Release -p:Platform=ARM64
```

> WinUI apps cannot target `AnyCPU`; always pass `-p:Platform=x64` or `-p:Platform=ARM64` for a
> single project. The runtime identifier is derived from `Platform` in the csproj, so the two can
> never drift apart. The whole solution builds with `dotnet build Anchor.slnx -c Release` (x64 is
> the default — don't add `-p:Platform=x64` at the solution level, which trips MSBuild's
> solution-configuration mapping).

To produce the distributable, self-contained folders and zips (what a release ships):

```powershell
pwsh scripts/package-release.ps1                     # both architectures, version from the csproj
pwsh scripts/package-release.ps1 -Version 1.1.0
pwsh scripts/package-release.ps1 -Architecture x64   # or arm64
```

It publishes to `publish\Anchor-win-<arch>\`, zips each to `dist\Anchor-win-<arch>-<version>.zip`
and prints each zip's SHA-256. The version comes from
[`src/Anchor/Anchor.csproj`](src/Anchor/Anchor.csproj) — bump `<Version>`, `<FileVersion>` and
`<AssemblyVersion>` together, since Settings ▸ About reads the assembly version. Current version:
**1.2.0**.

## Tests

There are two suites. The unit tests are the ones you run constantly; the UI smoke tests need a
real desktop and are opt-in.

```powershell
dotnet test tests/Anchor.Tests/Anchor.Tests.csproj -p:Platform=x64   # fast, headless
pwsh scripts/run-ui-tests.ps1                                        # launches the real app
```

`tests/Anchor.Tests/` covers the pure-logic pieces (`Models/`, `Services/DockItemFactory.cs`,
`Services/Loc.cs`, `Services/DockStore.cs`, `Services/UpdateService.cs`, `Services/ItemSearch.cs`,
`Services/FolderListing.cs`) with xUnit — the
`Kind → Glyph` mapping, cell sizing (including the density setting and the magnification clamp)
and property-change notifications on `DockItem`, the first-run defaults, dock-profile round-trip
and **upgrade-from-single-dock migration** of `DockConfig`, the defaults every new setting has to
keep so an upgrade doesn't change the dock under you, export/import round-tripping (and its refusal
to import a file that isn't an Anchor config), release-tag parsing, `DockItemFactory` classification
/ name suggestion, quick-launch ranking (a name match has to beat an item that merely matches by
path), a folder stack's ordering and hidden-file exclusion against a real directory, the command
line built when files are dropped on an app (a path with spaces must stay one argument), the
magnification curve, `HotkeyGesture` parsing / rendering / registrability, and the translation tables
(every language defines every English key, no blanks, no strays, matching `{0}` placeholders) plus
language resolution. It targets the same Windows-qualified TFM as the app (WinUI types like
`ImageSource` require it), so — like the app itself — it only builds and runs on Windows.

`tests/Anchor.UITests/` is the smoke harness for the shell / Win32 / live-XAML paths the unit
tests can't reach: it launches the **published** `Anchor.exe` and drives it through UI Automation
(via [FlaUI](https://github.com/FlaUI/FlaUI)'s UIA3 client), checking that the dock window appears,
that the seeded items render as named, invokable buttons, that the gear opens Settings and its
pages switch, that the Docks, Appearance and Shortcuts pages build their controls, that a group
opens a fly-out bar with its children in it, and that closing Settings doesn't take the dock down
with it. Notes:

- It is **not** in `Anchor.slnx`, so `dotnet build` / `dotnet test` on the solution stays exactly
  as fast and side-effect-free as before. `scripts/run-ui-tests.ps1` publishes the app, points
  `ANCHOR_EXE` at it and sets `ANCHOR_UITESTS=1`; without those the tests skip rather than fail.
- It needs an **interactive desktop** — a signed-in session with a visible desktop. It won't pass
  over a lock screen or on a headless CI agent.
- Each test runs Anchor against a throwaway `ANCHOR_DATA_DIR` under `%Temp%`, so **your own dock is
  never touched** — which is what makes it safe to cover reset and remove-item paths.
- UI Automation rather than WinAppDriver or Appium: no background server to install and keep
  running, no Node/npm, no protocol-version matching between client and driver, and UIA3 talks to
  WinUI 3's automation peers directly.

The network / registry pieces (`IconService`'s favicon fetch, `StartupService`) remain
integration-shaped and are verified by manual testing.

## Using it

- **Left-click** an icon to launch it (Space/Enter when it has keyboard focus works too). If that
  app is already open, the click brings its window forward instead — **Shift+click** to start a new
  instance anyway.
- **Hover or click a group** to open its fly-out bar — a second dock out of that icon — then click
  anything inside it. It closes again when the cursor leaves both the icon and the bar, or on a
  second click. Turning off Settings ▸ Appearance ▸ *Open groups on hover* makes the bar
  click-only: the cursor is ignored and a click both opens and closes it. A folder with *Show
  folder contents* on opens the same bar over its contents, on a click either way.
- **Hover** an icon for a Windows 11 taskbar-style highlight, or turn on
  Settings ▸ Appearance ▸ *Magnify on hover* for a macOS-style swell.
- **Drag an icon** to reorder it, **onto a group** to file it in there, or **sideways out of an
  open group bar** to put it back on the strip. **Drag the dock's background** (the padding around
  the icons, the divider, or the gear) to move the whole dock; drop it *at* a screen edge to snap
  and auto-hide behind that edge, or anywhere else to float.
- **Drag a file from Explorer** onto the dock to add it, onto an **app icon** to open it with that
  app, or onto a **group** to file it in there. The target icon swells to show which it will be.
- **Right-click an icon** → *Open, Edit…, Move to group ▸, Move left, Move right, Hide, Remove* —
  plus *Show folder contents* on a folder, *Move to dock ▸* once there is a second dock, and
  *Shortcut ▸* once per-item shortcuts are switched on. A group instead offers *Open group, Edit…,
  Ungroup*; a separator only the placement and removal commands.
- **Edit…** opens a small window carrying the item's **name**, its **target** and its **icon**,
  with the icon picker as a fly-out beside the icon field. It is reachable from Settings ▸ Apps &
  links too, from the pencil button on each row.
- **Gear button** → opens **Settings** (General + Appearance + Shortcuts + Docks + Apps & links +
  About).
- **Right-click the dock background** → *Add New…*, *Add separator*, *New group…*, *Search…*,
  *Settings…*, *Snap ▸*, *Gear to start/end*, *Add another dock*,
  *Remove this dock*, *Quit*. To unsnap, drag the dock away from the edge (or use
  Settings ▸ Docks ▸ *Dock position*).
- **Tray icon** (notification area) → **left-click** to bring every dock to the front;
  **right-click** for *Show/Hide dock*, *Search…*, *Add new…*, *Settings…*, *Quit Anchor*.
- **Ctrl+Alt+A** (default) from anywhere brings the docks to the front — the quickest way back to a
  dock that's auto-hidden behind an edge. Change or clear it in Settings ▸ Shortcuts, where you can
  also assign a shortcut for **quick-launch search** and switch on **per-item shortcuts**.

Because the dock stays off the taskbar, everything (including **Quit**) lives in the gear/settings,
the right-click menu and the tray icon. When snapped, move the cursor to that edge (within the
dock's span) — or onto the notch — to reveal it, or just press the shortcut.

## Run / debug in VS Code

Open the repo in VS Code and press **F5** (*Launch Anchor*), or run the **build** task
(`Ctrl+Shift+B`). Both are configured in `.vscode/` for the required `x64` platform.

## Configuration

All state is saved to a single JSON file:

```
%AppData%\Anchor\dock.json
```

Delete this file to reset the dock to its seeded defaults. Downloaded favicons are cached
separately under `%AppData%\Anchor\IconCache\` (one `<host>.ico` per site); deleting that folder
just forces the icons to be re-fetched.

Set **`ANCHOR_DATA_DIR`** to put both somewhere else — a folder on a removable drive for a truly
portable copy, or a throwaway folder for testing. It also scopes the single-instance check, so a
copy with its own data directory runs alongside your everyday one instead of quietly exiting.

The file is written atomically (write-to-temp then rename) so a crash mid-save can't corrupt it.
Enums are stored **by name**, and unset optional fields are omitted, so an older file still loads
after an upgrade (a missing `Theme`, for instance, defaults back to `Dark`).

**Upgrading from a single-dock config.** Before Anchor supported more than one dock, the items and
placement sat at the top level of this file. Such a file still loads: on first launch its dock is
folded into `Docks[0]` with every setting intact, and the file is rewritten in the new shape once,
right then. Nothing is lost, and nothing needs doing by hand.

```

You can hand-edit this file while Anchor is closed. `LaunchAtStartup` is only the app's *view* of
the Windows startup entry — Windows is the source of truth, and Anchor asks it rather than trusting
this field. In the portable build that entry is the `Anchor` value under
`HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`; in the Microsoft Store build it is the app's
registered startup task. Either way it shows up in **Task Manager ▸ Startup apps**, and turning it
off there wins — the Store build can't override that, and says so when you try.

A dock has no monitor field on purpose: which screen it lives on is simply the one `FreeX`/`FreeY`
fall on. That survives a reboot, a resolution change and a monitor being unplugged and plugged
back in far better than any display id would, and it means Settings ▸ Docks ▸ *Monitor* only has
to write coordinates.

Shortcuts (`Hotkey`, `SearchHotkey` and an item's own `Hotkey`) are stored as readable text
(`Ctrl+Alt+A`) rather than key codes, so they stay legible. Assignable keys are `A`–`Z`, `0`–`9`,
`F1`–`F24`, `Space`, `Enter`, `Tab`, `Backspace`, `Insert`, `Delete`, `Home`, `End`, `PageUp`,
`PageDown` and the four arrow keys; at least one of `Ctrl`, `Alt` or `Win` is required. A value
Anchor can't parse is treated as "no shortcut" — it never stops the config from loading.

**This file is also the backup format.** Settings ▸ General ▸ *Backup* exports exactly this shape,
so an exported file can be dropped straight into `%AppData%\Anchor\dock.json` by hand, and a
`dock.json` copied off another machine imports without conversion. Importing replaces every dock,
item and app-wide setting at once; there is no merge and no undo.

The **icon cache is deliberately not part of a backup**: it holds nothing but downloaded favicons,
which the new machine re-fetches on its own. Custom icons *are* preserved, because
`CustomIconPath` points at your own image file — so if you're moving between machines, copy that
file across too (or use a built-in glyph from the icon picker, which travels inside the config).

</details>

## Privacy & data

Anchor runs entirely on your PC. There are **no accounts, no telemetry, no analytics, and no ads**.
The full policy is in [`docs/privacy-policy.md`](docs/privacy-policy.md), which is also what the
Store listing points at and what **Settings ▸ About ▸ Privacy policy** opens.

- **Your data stays local.** Items, layout and settings live in `%AppData%\Anchor\dock.json`
  and never leave your device.
- **Web-link icons are the only network access by default.** For a web link, Anchor fetches the
  site's favicon — first directly from the site (`https://<host>/favicon.ico`), and only if that
  fails, from DuckDuckGo's icon service (`https://icons.duckduckgo.com/ip3/<host>.ico`), which
  receives just the site's domain. Nothing else is sent, and downloaded icons are cached under
  `%AppData%\Anchor\IconCache\` so a site is contacted at most once. If you never add a web link,
  Anchor makes no network requests at all.
- **The update check is the only other thing that can reach the network, and it is off until you
  turn it on.** With `"CheckForUpdates": true` in `dock.json`, the portable build asks the public
  GitHub releases API (`api.github.com/repos/framedparadox/anchor-dock/releases/latest`) once at
  startup whether a newer version exists. No token, no account, no identifier beyond the HTTP
  request itself; nothing is uploaded, and nothing is ever downloaded or installed for you — the
  most it does is open the release page in your browser. Leave it off (the default) and it never
  runs. The **Microsoft Store build has no update check at all** — the Store updates it.
- **Launching is a hand-off to Windows.** Opening an item hands it to the shell exactly as
  double-clicking it in Explorer would; Anchor does not read your files' contents. A folder
  fly-out lists a folder's file *names* to draw its icons; it does not open the files.

The same summary is available in-app under **Settings ▸ About ▸ Privacy**.

## Security notes

- **Anchor is a launcher, so it starts programs you pin.** Items are launched through
  `ShellExecute` (`Process.Start` with `UseShellExecute=true`) — the same mechanism as an Explorer
  double-click. It only ever launches what *you* explicitly added (via the Add window or
  drag-and-drop) and persisted to your own user-profile config; it does not run undisclosed code.
  Because the config is a plain file under your `%AppData%`, protect it as you would any file that
  can start programs at sign-in.
- **Input is validated at the edges.** Web links are constrained to `http`/`https` on every path
  that creates one (the Add window and drag-and-drop); arbitrary URIs and shell commands
  (`ms-settings:`, `shell:…`) are only accepted through the explicit *Shortcut* type.
- **Favicon downloads are bounded.** Responses are size-capped (~2 MB) and content-sniffed by
  magic bytes before decoding, so a non-image response can't be shown as a broken/oversized image.
  The cache filename is derived from the sanitized host, not free-form text.
- **No elevation required.** "Start with Windows" uses the per-user `HKCU` Run key in the portable
  build, and the packaged app's `windows.startupTask` in the Microsoft Store build (where a
  packaged process's Run-key writes would be virtualized away and never actually start anything).
  Neither prompts for admin rights, and both are visible to you in **Task Manager ▸ Startup apps**.

## Troubleshooting

- **Diagnostic log.** Anchor writes a lightweight log to `%Temp%\anchor.log` (truncated on each
  start). It records launches, icon-resolution fallbacks, and any otherwise-unhandled exception —
  the first place to look if something misbehaves.
- **An icon shows a globe/page glyph instead of a picture.** The shell thumbnail or favicon
  couldn't be resolved (e.g. the target no longer exists, or the site has no favicon / you're
  offline). Fix the target via the item's **Edit…** menu, or check connectivity for a web link.
- **The snapped dock seems to have vanished.** It auto-hid behind its edge — move the cursor to
  that screen edge (within the dock's span) or onto the small notch to reveal it. To stop it
  hiding, turn off **auto-hide** for that dock in **Settings ▸ Docks**.
- **A dock is off-screen after unplugging a monitor.** It gets clamped onto a remaining screen at
  the next layout; press **Ctrl+Alt+A** or click the tray icon to summon it. If it's still lost,
  **Settings ▸ Docks ▸ Monitor** re-centres it on the screen you pick.
- **An app that's clearly running has no dot.** The indicator needs a resolvable executable — a
  shortcut to a Store app or a control-panel item has none. It's also a 2-second poll, so give it
  a moment. Turn the feature off entirely in **Settings ▸ General**.
- **SmartScreen warns on first run.** Releases aren't code-signed yet. Choose *More info ▸ Run
  anyway*. The warning should clear after Windows has seen the binary a few times.
- **Reset everything.** Close Anchor and delete `%AppData%\Anchor\dock.json`, or use
  **Settings ▸ General ▸ Reset dock to defaults** (which asks for confirmation first, and closes
  any extra docks along with clearing the first).

App-wide state — config file, tray icon, global shortcut, running-app poll, Settings/Add windows —
belongs to `DockManager`; each `DockWindow` is purely one strip and its own placement.

<details>
<summary>Design decisions</summary>

- **Always-on glass.** WinUI normally collapses acrylic to a flat fallback color when its window
  is deactivated. Since a dock is never the foreground window, `AcrylicBackdropManager` keeps the
  `DesktopAcrylicController` alive so the glass never falls back.
- **Sizing.** The window is auto-sized to its content. The strip size is computed
  *analytically* — by summing each cell's own extent (`DockItem.CellExtent`, since a separator's
  slot is narrower than an icon's) rather than by measuring the live tree.
- **Reorder is measured against the *other* items.** With mixed cell widths, mapping the cursor
  onto a slot by walking the current order oscillates whenever a wide icon crosses a narrow
  separator. Instead the drag walks the layout with the dragged item excluded and inserts where
  the cursor passes each remaining item's midpoint.
- **A dock's monitor is its coordinates.** No display id is stored; the monitor is whichever
  screen `FreeX`/`FreeY` land on, since display ids aren't stable across sessions or re-plugs.
- **Running-app detection walks windows, not processes.** `RunningAppService` enumerates visible,
  un-owned, titled, non-tool top-level windows and maps each to its process's image path.
- **Single instance, scoped to the data directory.** A named mutex keyed by the data directory
  stops a second launch from stacking a duplicate set of docks, while a copy pointed at its own
  `ANCHOR_DATA_DIR` still runs independently.
- **Localization is a plain JSON dictionary**, not PRI/`.resw` — the app ships unpackaged and the
  language is a runtime app setting rather than the Windows display language.
- **One hidden HWND for shell messages.** The tray icon and `RegisterHotKey` both deliver their
  events as window messages, and a WinUI 3 `Window` exposes no `WndProc`. `MessageWindow` creates
  a single never-shown popup window on the UI thread to receive them.

## FAQ

**How do I quit Anchor?** Right-click the tray icon → *Quit Anchor*, right-click the dock
background → *Quit Anchor*, or open Settings from the gear. The dock is intentionally off the
taskbar, so there's no taskbar close button.

**Where did my dock go after I snapped it?** It auto-hides behind the edge. Reveal it by moving
the cursor to that screen edge or onto the notch, by pressing **Ctrl+Alt+A**, or by clicking the
tray icon; disable *Auto-hide when snapped* in Settings to keep it always visible.

**The shortcut doesn't work.** Another app almost certainly holds that combination — Settings
says so when it can't register, and shows the shortcut it tried. Pick a different one, or switch
the shortcut off if you don't want Anchor holding a global binding at all.

**Can I use a language you don't ship?** Not yet, but adding one is a single file: copy
`src/Anchor/Strings/en.json`, translate the values, and add the code to `Loc.Available`. The
tests will tell you if you missed a key.

**Can I run it on multiple monitors?** Yes, two ways. A single dock hides and reveals on whichever
monitor you dropped it on (an edge that borders another monitor still hides, but shrinks to the
notch in place rather than sliding, so it stays on its own screen instead of onto the neighbor's).
Or give each screen its own: **Settings ▸ Docks ▸ Add dock**, then pick its monitor — each dock
keeps its own items and edge.

**Can I use my own icon for an item?** Right-click it → **Edit…** → **Change icon…** and pick a
PNG, ICO, JPG, BMP or GIF. **Use the default icon** puts the shell/favicon icon back. (It's still the
`CustomIconPath` field in `dock.json` underneath, if you'd rather edit that.)

**How do I keep a long dock short?** Put related items in a group: right-click one →
**Move to group ▸ New group…**, then add more the same way. The group is a single icon that opens
a fly-out. **Ungroup** puts its contents back on the strip where the group was.

**Does it need admin rights?** No. Everything (including "start with Windows") is per-user.

**Is it on the Microsoft Store / winget?** Not yet. The MSIX and winget manifests live in this
repo; the public zip is what ships today. See [Install](#install).

**Does it work on Windows 10?** The floor is Windows 10 1809 (build 17763). It is designed and
tested on Windows 11; acrylic, rounded corners and the Mica Settings window all look their best
there.

**How is this different from RocketDock / ObjectDock / RoundedTB?** Those are (or were) theming
shells around the taskbar, or classic docks that fake transparency. Anchor is a **WinUI 3** app
that uses the real Windows 11 acrylic material, lives *beside* the taskbar rather than replacing
it, and is built to pin files and links as first-class items — not just apps.

**Can I run a portable copy next to my installed one?** Yes. Point `ANCHOR_DATA_DIR` at another
folder; the single-instance mutex is scoped to that directory.

## Known limitations

- **Shortcut keys come from a fixed table.** Assignable keys are a fixed, layout-independent set
  (see *Configuration*) so the stored text means the same thing on every keyboard layout, and there
  are no chorded or sequence shortcuts.
- **Translations are machine-assisted** and unreviewed by native speakers; corrections are welcome
  (`src/Anchor/Strings/*.json`).
- **Magnification stays inside the strip.** Icons swell within their own cell rather than popping
  up above the dock: the glass is a real `DesktopAcrylicBackdrop`, which paints the whole window
  and can't be masked, so a window tall enough for icons to rise out of the strip would be a slab
  of glass with icons along the bottom of it.
- **The auto-hide slide is timer-driven**, not a Composition animation — hiding moves the *window*
  off the screen edge, and Composition animates content *inside* a window. It is a fixed-duration
  eased `AppWindow.MoveAndResize`, which is smooth, but it is a timer. On an edge shared with
  another monitor the window shrinks to the notch in place instead (so it can't cross onto the
  neighbor's screen even mid-hide), and that transition is an instant snap rather than a slide.
- **Web-link icons** fetch the site favicon (site `/favicon.ico`, then a favicon service),
  falling back to a globe glyph when a site has none or there's no connectivity.
- **Groups don't nest, and can't hold separators.** A group's children are always leaves. Both
  would give the fly-out bar a structure it has no way to render, and neither earns the complexity.
- **A folder fly-out opens on click, not hover** (a group's does both, unless *Open groups on
  hover* is switched off), and it
  lists at most 60 entries (hidden and system entries excluded) — past that, its *Open in File
  Explorer* cell is the answer. The listing is a snapshot taken when the bar opens; it doesn't
  watch the folder for changes.
- **Running-app indicators only cover apps with a resolvable exe.** A `.lnk` is followed to its
  target, but a shortcut to a Store app or a control-panel item has no file-system target, so it
  never lights up. Detection is a 2-second poll (Windows raises no event for "an app opened its
  first window"), so a dot can lag reality by that much.
- **Per-monitor docks are positional.** A dock's screen is wherever its stored coordinates fall.
  Unplug that monitor and the dock is clamped onto a remaining one — sensible, but it does not
  remember where it came from and will not move back on its own when the display returns.
- **Importing a backup replaces everything.** There's no merge and no undo; export first if you
  want to keep what you have.
- **UI smoke tests need a real desktop.** They launch the app and drive it through UI Automation,
  so they can't run headless or over a lock screen, and they're excluded from the solution and
  opt-in for that reason — including in CI, where they need a self-hosted windowed runner.
- **Releases aren't code-signed yet**, so SmartScreen may warn on first run — choose
  *More info ▸ Run anyway*. x64 and ARM64 are both built; there's no x86 build.

## Roadmap

The original roadmap has been worked through — see [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) for what landed
and, where an item turned out not to be buildable as written, why. What is left is below. Nothing
here is committed or scheduled; comments and PRs are welcome — open an issue first for the bigger
items.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. A few things that keep the bar consistent:

- Build with `-p:Platform=x64` (WinUI can't be `AnyCPU`) and keep the build **warning-free**.
  If you touch anything platform-shaped, check `-p:Platform=ARM64` still builds too.
- Add or update tests under `tests/Anchor.Tests/` for any pure-logic change, and run
  `dotnet test` before opening a PR.
- If you change the dock's windows, item template or the Settings pages, run
  `pwsh scripts/run-ui-tests.ps1` as well — those tests find elements by `AutomationId` and by the
  name Narrator announces, so they break exactly when the accessibility surface does.
- Adding a user-visible string means adding it to **all eight** `src/Anchor/Strings/*.json`;
  `LocTests` fails the build otherwise, and English-only keys silently ship English to everyone.
- Match the existing commenting style — explain *why*, not just *what*, especially around the
  Win32/DWM interop and the drag/auto-hide timing.
- UI-affecting changes can't be unit-tested here; smoke-test them on Windows and note what you
  checked (see *Using it*).
