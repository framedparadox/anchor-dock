/// <summary>
/// A curated set of built-in Segoe Fluent Icons glyphs offered by the icon picker, as a
/// no-network, no-file-dialog alternative to browsing for a custom image. Deliberately a small,
/// general-purpose set — enough to tell a "Dev tools" group from a "Media" group at a glance —
/// not an exhaustive dump of every icon Windows ships.
/// <para>
/// <see cref="Choice.Name"/> is a plain English literal rather than routed through
/// <see cref="Loc"/>: it is a mnemonic label on a swatch grid (the glyph itself is the content
/// being chosen), not a sentence a non-English speaker needs translated to use the feature —
/// the same scoping most icon/color pickers give their swatch names. Every other string in the
/// picker's chrome (title, the "browse for an image" entry) is fully localized as usual.
